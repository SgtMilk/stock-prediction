# stock-prediction

A stock prediction ML repo using PyTorch

# Required packages

I am way too lazy to use a virtual environment, so just run the following command to install everything:

`sudo bash scripts/install_pt.sh`

# Note to the user

The backend services included in this repo are not scalable. I would strongly advise to write your own backend services 
if you want to use this in a large-scale system.
